Welcome to Connect Four, my version of the popular two player game released by Milton Bradley in 1974. In this version - created with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React - I implemented CSS animations and a dynamically rendering board, game status, and rematch option.

Game rules per Wikipedia: "Players first choose a color and then take turns dropping one colored disc from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. Connect Four is a solved game. The first player can always win by playing the right moves."
